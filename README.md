LibNoise.NET
==============

A Fork (with nuget support) of the seemingly (approx. four years) dead [LibNoise.NET](https://libnoisedotnet.codeplex.com/).

Here's the full previous description, for posterity:

>A C# port of libnoise (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libnoise/), a general-purpose library that generates three-dimensional coherent noise.
